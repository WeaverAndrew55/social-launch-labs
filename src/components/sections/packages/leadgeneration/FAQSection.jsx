      question: "What kind of businesses benefit most from the Lead Generation Mastery package?",
      answer: "This package is ideal for knowledge-based businesses that want to establish authority and generate consistent leads. It works especially well for consultants, professional service firms, B2B companies, and specialized solution providers who have expertise that can be showcased through educational content."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer: "Most clients begin to see an increase in engagement and lead flow within the first 4-8 weeks. However, the full impact of an authority-based lead generation strategy typically develops over 3-6 months as your content library grows and your audience becomes more familiar with your expertise. This is why we recommend a minimum 3-month commitment."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between this and just hiring a social media manager?",
      answer: "The Lead Generation Mastery package is specifically designed to convert your expertise into inbound leads, not just create social media content. While a social media manager might focus on engagement and brand awareness, our package includes strategic content planning, professional video production, lead magnet creation, and multi-channel distributionâ€”all aligned with your business goals and focused on generating qualified leads."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to appear in the videos myself?",
      answer: "While featuring the actual experts in your business tends to create the strongest connection with your audience, we can work with you to find the right approach. Some clients prefer to share their expertise through interviews, narrated presentations, or animated explainer videos if they're not comfortable on camera. We'll help determine the best format for your specific situation and target audience."
    },
    {
      question: "How much time will I need to commit to this process each month?",
      answer: "We've designed this package to be minimally invasive to your schedule. Typically, clients spend about 2-3 hours per month in planning sessions, content reviews, and video recording. Our team handles all the heavy lifting of planning, production, editing, and distribution, allowing you to focus on your core business."
    },
    {
      question: "What if we already have some content created?",
      answer: "Great! We'll start with an audit of your existing content and identify opportunities to optimize, repurpose, or expand upon what you already have. This can accelerate results as we'll integrate your current assets into the new strategy rather than starting from scratch."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure success and report on results?",
      answer: "We track key metrics aligned with your business goals, including content reach, engagement rates, lead generation numbers, conversion rates, and ultimately new business acquired. You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing performance across all channels, with insights and recommendations for optimization."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we customize the package to fit our specific needs?",
      answer: "Absolutely. While the Lead Generation Mastery package provides a comprehensive foundation, we understand that each business has unique needs. During our initial strategy session, we'll identify any specific requirements or preferences you have, and can tailor certain elements of the package accordingly."
